# download-assets

Downloads all assets in a Scratch library file. Output is stored in the `out` folder.

(Note that filter-svgs only requires SVG files to be downloaded - you could tweak this code to only fetch files where the MD5 ends with `.svg`, if you don't want to download more than necessary.)
