# scratch-library-filter

Some simple scripts to filter the costume and backdrop libraries by SVGs only: https://github.com/LLK/scratch-gui/issues/913

This filter also removes SVGs which contain the string `<image` (which is assumed to mean a bitmap image embed).

(`costumes.json` and `backdrops.json`, as well as the filtered outputs of this program, are stored in this repository alongside the code. Only the code (.JS files) is considered to be under the license as stated in LICENSE.txt. The library JSONs were gotten from the [libraries](https://github.com/LLK/scratch-gui/tree/c8c923b919a73671f820a1cc064b66c64cab2adc/src/lib/libraries) directory in [LLK/scratch-gui](https://github.com/LLK/scratch-gui).)
